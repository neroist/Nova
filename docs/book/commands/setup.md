## Setup

`setup` is a command for setting up Nova. Nova is required to be setup for Nova to work.

> Note: you *may* need to give your shell root/administrator permissions
> for this command to work.

> If this command still doesn't work, make a file called ".KEY" in the same
> directory that Nova is in and put your Govee API key in it.
