## Important Notes

**Positional arguments are not supported.** For example: `nova color 0 "aliceblue"` will not work and throw an error. You will have to explicitly declare every argument you pass into the command. For example: `nova color -d 0 -c "aliceblue"`. Also, see [`setup`](https://neroist.github.io/Nova/commands/setup.html).

In addition, please refrain from calling commands too quickly or frequently.

## Installation

You can just download the installer from the [most recent version](https://github.com/neroist/nova/releases/latest), or from `winget` by running:

```sh
winget install Jasmine.Nova
```

For linux, download `installer.sh` and run

```sh
sudo sh installer.sh
```

## How to get Govee API key

1. Open the Govee Home mobile app.
2. Go to the "My Profile" tab, go to settings (the gear in the top right), press "Apply for API key"
3. Fill out your name and your reason (for the reason you can just write "I would like to control my LEDs with a CLI" and it should be fine) and submit.

You should receive an email with your API key soon.

## Deletion

1. Delete Nova from whatever directory you put it in (or delete the directory itself).

   Or, if you installed with the Windows installer, open Settings, go to Apps, then search for "Nova". When you see Nova, click the three dots and hit "Uninstall."
